Yesterday (May 3rd, 2017) there has been a discussion on a work for Theano 2.0 that is lead by Bart at MILA. I've thought I could contribute but beforehand I'd just find a bunch of implementations of automatic differentiation and find what is most suitable one for Theano's use in the future.

I'm trying to keep up with the new C++17 standard or C++1z.
